\chapter{Description Logics}
\label{cha:description-logics}

Description logics~\cite{DLhandbook} are a family of logic-based formalisms for knowledge
representation.  In this section, we shall introduce some basic notions of description
logics as they are needed for the purpose of this work.  This shall include a discussion
of some of the basic \emph{syntax} and \emph{semantics} of description logics
(Section~\ref{sec:basic-noti-descr}), as well as a discussion of \emph{knowledge bases}
and \emph{standard reasoning tasks} (Section~\ref{sec:knowledge-bases}).

Our focus in this work will be upon the light-weight description logic \ELbot, which shall
be the target logic for the knowledge we want to extract from data.  However, at a later
point in this work we shall see that the expressivity of \ELbot is not sufficient for our
needs, and that we need to consider an extension of \ELbot instead.  This extension shall
be the logic \ELgfpbot, an extension of \ELbot by \emph{greatest fixpoint semantics}.  We
shall introduce the syntax and semantics of \ELgfpbot in
Section~\ref{sec:descr-logics-elbot}.

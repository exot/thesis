\section{Formal Contexts and Concept Lattices}
\label{sec:form-cont-cont}

We introduce the basic notions of formal concept analysis in this section.  Most
importantly, we shall discuss how formal concept analysis allows us to represent
complete lattices in terms of \emph{formal concept lattices} using the notion of
\emph{formal contexts}.  Moreover, we shall introduce the notion of a \emph{Galois
  connection} between two ordered sets.

Let us briefly repeat the basic notions of order theory which are relevant for our further
considerations.  Let $P$ be a set and let ${\le} \subseteq P \times P$ be a binary
relation on $P$.  Then the pair $(P, \le)$ is called an \emph{(partially) ordered set} if
$\le$ is reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric.  Such structures can be visualize in
terms of \emph{order diagrams} (often called \emph{Hasse diagrams}) if they are finite
(and not too large).  For this way call two elements $x, y \in P$ with $x < y$
\emph{directly neighbored} in $(P, \le)$ if and only if there does not exist an element $z
\in P$ such that $x < z < y$.  Then to visualize $(P, \le)$ we mark for every element
$x \in P$ a node $v_x$ on the plane such that whenever $x < y$ it is true that the
ordinate (the second coordinate) of $v_x$ is strictly smaller then the one of $v_y$.
Then, we draw for every two elements $x, y$ with $x < y$ which are directly neighbored in
$(P, \le)$ an undirected line from $v_x$ to $v_y$.

Observe that this construction is not unique, and are many different possibilities (good
and bad) to visualize ordered sets in this way.  Also note that the naming $v_x$ of
vertices for elements $x$ is arbitrary and can be chosen as it suits.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:1}
  Let us consider the set $\set{1, 2, 3}$ with the usual order $\le$ on natural numbers.
  Then a line diagram of this order set is
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style = {draw, circle, inner sep = 1pt}]
      \node (A) {$3$};
      \node[below of=A] (B) {$2$};
      \node[below of=B] (C) {$1$};
      \draw (A) -- (B);
      \draw (B) -- (C);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  We can readily read of this diagram that $1 < 2$ and $2 < 3$, because there are lines
  connecting the corresponding vertices.  But we can also see that $1 < 3$ because there
  is an \emph{ascending path} from $1$ to $3$.
\end{Example}

More generally, in a line diagram of an ordered set $(P, \le)$, two elements $x, y \in P$
satisfy $x \le y$ if and only if there is an ascending path from $x$ to $y$ in the line
diagram (where also paths of length 0 are allowed).

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:2}
  Let $P = \set{ 1, 2, 3 }$ and consider the ordered set $(\subsets{\set{1,2,3}},
  \subseteq)$, where $\subsets{\set{1,2,3}}$ denotes the set of all subsets of
  $\set{1,2,3}$.  This set can be visualized as a line diagram as follows:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style = {draw, circle, inner sep = 1pt}]
      \node (0) at (0,0)  {\tiny 000};
      \node (1) at (-1,1) {\tiny 100};
      \node (2) at (0, 1) {\tiny 010};
      \node (3) at (1, 1) {\tiny 001};
      \node (4) at (-1,2) {\tiny 110};
      \node (5) at (0,2)  {\tiny 101};
      \node (6) at (1,2)  {\tiny 011};
      \node (7) at (0,3)  {\tiny 111};
      \draw{
        (0) -- (1)
        (0) -- (2)
        (0) -- (3)
        (1) -- (4)
        (1) -- (5)
        (2) -- (4)
        (2) -- (6)
        (3) -- (5)
        (3) -- (6)
        (4) -- (7)
        (5) -- (7)
        (6) -- (7)
      };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  Here we denote subsets of $\set{1,2,3}$ by sequences of 0 and 1, meaning that if the
  first position is 1 if and only if the number 1 is an element of the corresponding
  subset, and so on.  Then 101 corresponds to the set $\set{1,3}$.
\end{Example}

An element $x \in P$ is said to be the \emph{smallest element} of $(P, \le)$ if and only
if $x \le y$ is true for all $y \in P$.  Likewise, $x$ is the \emph{greatest element} of
$(P, \le)$ if and only if $y \le x$ is true for all $y \in P$.  Note that neither smallest
nor greatest elements have to exist in $P$.  However, if these elements exist, they are
unique up to equivalence.

Let $Q \subseteq P$.  An element $x \in Q$ is said to be the \emph{smallest element} in
$Q$ (with respect to $(P, \le)$) if and only if $x \le y$ is true for all $y \in Q$;
\emph{greatest element} in $Q$ are defined likewise.  Again, neither smallest nor greatest
elements in $Q$ have to exist.

Let $x \in P$.  The \emph{order-ideal} ${\downarrow}x$ and the \emph{order-filter}
${\uparrow} x$ of $x$ in $(P, \le)$ are defined as
\begin{align*}
  {\downarrow} x &:= \set{ y \in P \mid y \le x },\\
  {\uparrow} x &:= \set{ y \in P \mid x \le y }.
\end{align*}
In other words, ${\downarrow} x$ contains all elements which are \emph{below} $x$ in $(P,
\le)$, and ${\uparrow} x$ contains all elements which are \emph{above} $x$ in $(P, \le)$.

Let again $Q \subseteq P$.  Then the sets ${\downarrow} Q$ and ${\uparrow} Q$ defined as
\begin{align*}
  {\uparrow} Q &:= \bigcap_{q \in Q} {\uparrow} q,\\
  {\downarrow} Q &:= \bigcap_{q \in Q} {\downarrow} q
\end{align*}
are called the set of \emph{upper bounds} and \emph{lower bounds} of $Q$ in $(P, \le)$,
respectively, where we employ the convention that $\bigcap \emptyset = P$.  If ${\uparrow}
Q$ has a smallest element (a \emph{least upper bound}) in $(P, \le)$, it is called the
\emph{supremum} of $Q$ in $(P, \le)$ and is denoted by $\sup Q$.  Likewise, if
${\downarrow} Q$ has a greatest element (a \emph{greatest lower bound}) in $(P, \le)$,
then it is called the \emph{infimum} of $Q$ in $(P, \le)$ and is denoted by $\inf Q$.

Note again that neither infimum nor supremum have to exist in $(P, \le)$.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:3}
  Let $P = \set{ a, b, c }$ and let $\le$ be given by the smallest order relation that
  satisfies $a < b$ and $a < c$.  Then $\inf\set{b,c}$ exists in $(P, \le)$ and is equal
  to $a$.  However, $\sup\set{b, c}$ does not exist in $(P, \le)$, as ${\uparrow} b \cap
  {\uparrow} c = \emptyset$.
\end{Example}

\noindent%
Structures in which supremum and infimum always exist for \emph{finite} sets $Q$ are
called \emph{lattices}.  If the sets $Q$ can be chosen arbitrary, then we call such a
structure a \emph{complete lattice}.

\begin{Definition}[Lattice]
  \label{def:lattice}
  Let $\mathbb L = (L, \le)$ be an ordered set.  Then $\mathbb L$ is called a
  \emph{lattice} if and only if for each finite $Q \subseteq L$ there exist both $\sup Q$
  and $\inf Q$ in $\mathbb L$.  If for all $Q \subseteq L$ there exist both $\sup Q$ and
  $\inf Q$ in $\mathbb L$, then $\mathbb L$ is called a \emph{complete lattice}.
\end{Definition}

\noindent%
Note that every finite lattice is also a complete lattice.  Moreover, every complete
lattice has a smallest and greatest element, given by $\sup\emptyset$ and $\inf\emptyset$,
respectively.  Furthermore, every ordered set $(P, \le)$ in which the supremum exists for
each $Q \subseteq P$ is already a complete lattice, as the infimum is then given by
\begin{equation*}
  \inf Q = \sup\set{ x \in P \mid \forall y \in Q \holds x \le y }.
\end{equation*}
The same is of course true if supremum and infimum are exchanged.

The ordered sets from Examples~\ref{expl:1} and~\ref{expl:2} are lattices, but not the one
from~\ref{expl:3}.  More generally, if $P$ is a set, then $(\subsets{P}, \subseteq)$ is
always a complete lattice.

The study of lattices as mathematical structures has received much interest over the last
decades and thus constitutes a major branch of order theory.\todo{cite main book on
  lattice theory} However, (complete) lattices also allow for a quite natural
interpretation as a hierarchy of \emph{generalizations} and \emph{specializations}: an
element $x$ is below an element $y$ if and only if $x$ is more \emph{special} than $y$, or
alternatively, if $y$ is more \emph{general} than $x$.  Then for a set $Q$ of elements its
supremum $\sup Q$ can be thought of as a \emph{most-specific generalization} of all
elements in $Q$, and $\inf Q$ can be seen likewise as the most \emph{general
  specialization} of all elements in $Q$.

Formal concept analysis now provides an approach to understand complete lattice in terms
of this interpretation, by representing these lattices in terms of \emph{objects} and
their \emph{attributes}.  For this, we need to introduce the notion of a \emph{formal
  context}.

\begin{Definition}[Formal Context]
  \label{def:formal-context}
  A \emph{formal context} $\con K$ is constituted of three sets $G, M, I$, where $I
  \subseteq G \times M$.  Most often, we shall identify $\con K$ with the triple $(G, M,
  I)$, \ie $\con K = (G, M, I)$.  We shall call $G$ the set of \emph{objects} of $\con K$,
  $M$ the set of \emph{attributes} of $\con K$ and $I$ the \emph{incidence} of $\con K$.
  Two formal contexts are equal if and only if their sets of objects, attributes and their
  incidences are equal, respectively.
\end{Definition}

Formal contexts can be thought of as simple data structures which record for a set of
objects the set of attributes those objects have.  More precisely, we shall say that in a
formal context $\con K$ an object $g \in G$ \emph{has} an attribute $m$ if and only if
$(g, m) \in I$.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:star-trek}
  Let us consider a small toy example $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ to illustrate the definition
  of a formal context.  As sets of objects we choose some fictional characters from
  \emph{Star Trek: The Next Generation}, namely
  \begin{equation*}
    G := \set{ \mathsf{Picard}, \mathsf{Worf}, \mathsf{Data}, \mathsf{BorgQueen} }.
  \end{equation*}
  As sets of attributes we choose
  \begin{equation*}
    M := \set{ \mathsf{Human}, \mathsf{Honorable}, \mathsf{Artificial}, \mathsf{Star
        Fleet} }.
  \end{equation*}
  To illustrate the incidence relation of our examples formal context we make use of a
  \emph{cross table}, \ie we depict $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ as a table where the rows are
  labeled with objects and the columns are labeled with attributes.  Then in every cell we
  write a cross if and only if the objects labeling the corresponding row has the
  attribute labeling the corresponding column.
  \begin{equation*}
    \def\x{\times}
    \begin{array}{r|*{4}{c}}
      \toprule
      \con K_{\mathsf{TNG}} & \mathsf{Human} & \mathsf{Honorable} & \mathsf{Artificial} & \mathsf{Star Fleet} \\
      \midrule
      \mathsf{Picard} & \x & \x & & \x \\
      \mathsf{Worf} & & \x & & \x \\
      \mathsf{Data} & & \x & \x & \x \\
      \mathsf{BorgQueen} & & & \x & \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  Then \textsf{BorgQueen} has the attribute \textsf{Artificial}, but not \textsf{Honorable}.
\end{Example}

To now expose the connection between formal contexts on the one hand and complete lattices
on the other we shall introduce the \emph{derivation operators} in formal contexts.

\begin{Definition}[Contextual Derivation]
  \label{def:contextual-derivation}
  Let $\con K = (G, M, I)$ be a formal context and let $A \subseteq G$ be a set of
  objects.  Then the set of \emph{common attributes} $A'$ of $A$ is defined to be
  \begin{equation*}
    A' := \set{ m \in M \mid \forall g \in G \holds (g, m) \in I }.
  \end{equation*}
  Likewise, for a set $B \subseteq M$ of attributes we define the set $B'$ of \emph{shared
    objects} as
  \begin{equation*}
    B' := \set{ g \in G \mid \forall m \in M \holds (g, m) \in I }.
  \end{equation*}
  The functions $A \mapsto A'$ and $B \mapsto B'$ are called the \emph{derivation
    operators} of $\con K$, and the sets $A'$ and $B'$ are called the \emph{derivations}
  of $A$ and $B$ in $\con K$, respectively.
\end{Definition}

For $(A')'$ we may also simply write $A''$.

Note that both derivation operators are denoted by $(\cdot)'$, which usually does not lead
to confusion, as it is most often clear from the context whether we deal with a set of
objects or a set of attributes from which we want to compute its derivation.  If it
nevertheless happens that a single name for the derivation operator leads to confusion,
then we shall locally introduce separate names for both of them.

What occurs more often, for example in Chapters~\ref{cha:expl-conf}
and~\ref{cha:model-expl-conf}, is the derivation of sets in \emph{different contexts}.
For example we may have given two formal contexts $\con K_1 = (G_1, M_1, I_1)$ and $\con
K_2 = (G_2, M_2, I_2)$ and a set $A \subseteq M_1 \cap M_2$.  Then when writing $A'$ it is
not clear in which context we do the derivation.  To remedy this, we shall add a subscript
to the set $A$ to make clear of which context we consider it as a set of attributes:
$A_{\con K_1}$ denotes the set $A$ considered as a set of attributes in $\con K_1$, and
likewise $A_{\con K_2}$.  While this notation is not useful as it stands, it becomes handy
if we consider derivations of $A$: $(A_{\con K_1})'$ denotes the derivation of $A$ in the
formal context $\con K_1$, while $(A_{\con K_2})'$ does the same for the formal context
$\con K_2$.  Of course, we can drop the parentheses if they do not lead to ambiguity and
write $A_{\con K_1}'$ and $A_{\con K_2}'$ instead.  Of course, the same can be done for
sets of objects.  In particular, instead of writing $(A_{\con K_1}')_{\con K_1}'$ we shall
often only write $A_{\con K_1}''$.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:4}
  Consider our Star Trek example context from~\ref{expl:star-trek} and let $A :=
  \set{\mathsf{Human}}$.  Then $A' = \set{ \mathsf{Picard} }$, $A'' = \set{
    \mathsf{Human}, \mathsf{Honorable}, \mathsf{Star Fleet} }$, and $A''' = \set{
    \mathsf{Picard} } = A'$.
\end{Example}

The case that $A''' = A'$ is true in the previous example is not a coincidence, but rather
an instance of a more general result: the derivation operators of a formal context form a
\emph{Galois connection} between the ordered sets $(\subsets{G}, \subseteq)$ and
$(\subsets{M}, \subseteq)$.

\begin{Lemma}
  \label{lem:derivation-is-galois-connection}
  Let $\con K = (G, M, I)$ be a formal context and let $A \subseteq M$ and $B \subseteq
  G$.  Then it is true that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    A \subseteq B' \iff B \subseteq A'.
  \end{equation}
  From this the following properties of the derivation operators of $\con K$ can be
  derived: let $A, A_1, A_2 \subseteq M$ and $B, B_1, B_2 \subseteq G$.  Then
  \begin{enumerate}[i. ]
  \item $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \implies A_2' \subseteq A_1'$,
  \item $B_1 \subseteq B_2 \implies B_2' \subseteq B_1'$,
  \item $A \subseteq A''$,
  \item $B \subseteq B''$,
  \item $A' = A'''$,
  \item $B' = B'''$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Lemma}
%
In the proof of the lemma we shall only show Equation~\eqref{eq:1}, as the remaining
claims are a then an immediate consequence of the more general result
Lemma~\ref{lem:properties-of-galois-connections} on Galois connections.
%
\begin{Proof}[\thref{lem:derivation-is-galois-connection}]
  We can easily compute that
  \begin{align*}
    A \subseteq B'
    & \iff \forall m \in A \holds m \in B' \\
    & \iff \forall m \in A \;\forall g \in B \holds (g,m) \in I \\
    & \iff \forall g \in B \;\forall m \in A \holds (g,m) \in I \\
    & \iff \forall g \in B \holds g \in A' \\
    & \iff B \subseteq A'
  \end{align*}
  which shows the claim.
\end{Proof}

Another useful property of the derivation operators is
\begin{equation*}
  A' = \bigcap_{a \in A} \set{a}'
\end{equation*}
for $A \subseteq M$.  This can easily be generalized into the following statement.

\begin{Lemma}
  \label{lem:piecewise-derivation}
  Let $\con K = (G, M, I)$ be a formal context, let $A \subseteq M$ and let $(B_j \mid j
  \in J)$ be a family of sets $B_j \subseteq M$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    A = \bigcup_{j \in J} B_j.
  \end{equation*}
  Then
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    A' = \bigcap \set{ B_j' \mid j \in J }.
  \end{equation}
  In particular, for every $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \subsets{M}$ it is true that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:3}
    \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A' = \bigl(\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A'\bigr).
  \end{equation}
\end{Lemma}
%
Of course, the same is true if $A$ and all $B_j$ are sets of objects instead of sets of
attributes.
%
\begin{Proof}[\thref{lem:piecewise-derivation}]
  Since $B_j \subseteq A$ for all $j \in J$, we can infer from
  \thref{lem:derivation-is-galois-connection} that $A' \subseteq B_j'$.  It therefore
  suffices to show that $A' \supseteq \bigcap \set{ B_j' \mid j \in J }$.

  To this end, let $g \in \bigcap \set{ B_j' \mid j \in J }$.  Then $g \in B_j'$ for each
  $j \in J$, and therefore $\set{g}' \supseteq B_j$, again for all $j \in J$.  Since $A =
  \bigcup_{j \in J} B_j$, we obtain from this that $\set{g}' \supseteq A$, and thus $g \in
  A'$, as required.
\end{Proof}

We have claimed earlier that there exists a close connection between complete lattices on
the one hand and formal contexts on the other.  Having introduced the derivation
operators, we are now able to expose this connection.  To this end, we shall introduce the
notion of \emph{formal concepts} of a formal context.

\begin{Definition}[Formal Concept]
  \label{def:formal-concept}
  Let $\con K = (G, M, I)$ be a formal context.  Then a \emph{formal concept} of $\con K$
  is a pair $(A, B)$ such that $A \subseteq G, B \subseteq M$, and $A' = B, B' = A$ holds.
  The first entry of a formal concept is called its \emph{extent}, and the second one
  called its \emph{intent}.  The set of all formal concepts of $\con K$ is denoted by
  $\BV(\con K)$, the set of all extents of (formal concepts of) $\con K$ is denoted by
  $\Ext\con K$, and the set of all intents of (formal concepts of) $\con K$ is denoted by
  $\Int\con K$.
\end{Definition}

Note that for each $A \subseteq M$, the pair $(A, A')$ is a formal concept of $\con K$.
Moreover, a set $A \subseteq M$ is an intent of $\con K$ if and only if $A = A''$: if $A =
A''$, then $(A'', A')$ is a formal concept of $\con K$, and if $(A, B)$ is a formal
concept of $\con K$, then $A'' = B' = A$.  The same is of course true for $B \subseteq G$:
$B$ is an extent of $\con K$ if and only if $B = B''$.

Formal concepts have a strong philosophical motivation, as they are an attempt to
formalize the rather vague notion of a \emph{concept}.  This formalization is based on the
perception that every formal concept is uniquely determined by the objects which are
instances of it, its \emph{extension}, as well as by a characterization in terms of
attributes, its \emph{intension}.  We shall, however, not pursue this philosophical
motivation any further here, as it is not immediately relevant for our work.
See~\cite{fca-book} for further discussion and references.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:5}
  Two formal concepts of $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ from Example~\ref{expl:star-trek} are
  \begin{gather*}
    (\set{\mathsf{Picard}}, \set{\mathsf{Human}, \mathsf{Honorable},
      \mathsf{StarFleet}}),\\
    (\set{\mathsf{Picard}, \mathsf{Worf}, \mathsf{Data}}, \set{\mathsf{Honorable}}).
  \end{gather*}
  The first formal concept could be said to represent the concept of an \emph{honorable
    human}, which in $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ has \textsf{Picard} as its only instance.
  The second formal concept describes everything \emph{honorable}, having as extension
  \textsf{Picard}, \textsf{Worf} and \textsf{Data}.
\end{Example}

Formal concepts can be ordered by \emph{generality}: a formal concept $(A_1, B_1)$ is
\emph{more general} than another formal concept $(A_2, B_2)$ if it covers more objects,
\ie if
\begin{equation*}
  A_1 \subseteq A_2.
\end{equation*}

\begin{Definition}[Concept Lattice]
  \label{def:concept-lattice}
  Let $\con K = (G, M, I)$ be a formal context.  We define the relation $\le$ on $\BV(\con
  K)$ by
  \begin{equation*}
    (A_1, B_1) \leq (A_2, B_2) \diff A_1 \subseteq A_2.
  \end{equation*}
  The structure $\alg{\BV}(\con K) := (\BV(\con K), \leq)$ is called the \emph{concept
    lattice} of $\con K$.
\end{Definition}

By \thref{lem:derivation-is-galois-connection} we can observe that
\begin{equation*}
  (A_1, B_1) \leq (A_2, B_2) \iff B_2 \subseteq B_1,
\end{equation*}
as $B_1 = A_1'$ and $B_2 = A_2'$.  Furthermore, it is rather easy to see that the relation
$\leq$ from \thref{def:concept-lattice} is an order relation on $\BV(\con K)$.  However,
even more is true, namely that $\alg{\BV}(\con K)$ is indeed a complete lattice.

\begin{Theorem}
  \label{thm:concept-lattices-are-complete-lattices}
  Let $\con K$ be a formal context.  Then $\alg{\BV}(\con K)$ is a complete lattice, and
  for formal concepts $((A_j, B_j) \mid j \in J)$ of $\con K$ we have
  \begin{align*}
    \sup \set{ (A_j, B_j) \mid j \in J } = \Bigl( \bigl( \bigcap_{j \in J} B_j \bigr)' ,
    \bigcap_{j \in J} B_j \Bigr), \\
    \inf \set{ (A_j, B_j) \mid j \in J } = \Bigl( \bigcap_{j \in J} A_j, \bigl( \bigcap_{j
      \in J} A_j \bigr)' \Bigr).
  \end{align*}
\end{Theorem}

On the other hand, every complete lattice can be represented as a concept lattice of a
suitably chosen formal context.  To formalize this correctly, we shall introduce the
notion of an \emph{order isomorphism} between two ordered sets.

\begin{Definition}[Order Isomorphism]
  \label{def:order-isomorphism}
  Let $\mathbb P = (P, \leq_1)$ and $\mathbb Q = (Q, \leq_2)$ be two ordered sets.  A
  bijective mapping $\phi \colon P \to Q$ is called an \emph{order isomorphism} if and
  only if $\phi$ is \emph{order-preserving} and \emph{order-reflecting}, \ie it is true
  for all $a, b \in P$ that
  \begin{equation*}
    a \leq_1 b \iff \phi(a) \leq_2 \phi(b).
  \end{equation*}
\end{Definition}

The statement now is that every for complete lattice is \emph{order-isomorphic} to some
concept lattice.

\begin{Theorem}
  \label{thm:complete-lattices-are-concept-lattices}
  Let $\mathbb V = (V, \leq_V)$ be a complete lattice.  Then the mapping $\phi \colon V
  \to \BV(\con K)$ defined by
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi(v) := (\set{ w \in V \mid w \leq_V v}, \set{ w \in V \mid v \leq_V w })
  \end{equation*}
  is an order isomorphism between $\mathbb V$ and $\alg{\BV}(V, V, \leq_V)$.
\end{Theorem}

Both \thref{thm:concept-lattices-are-complete-lattices} and
\thref{thm:complete-lattices-are-concept-lattices} are actually part of the Basic Theorem
of formal concept analysis~\cite[Theorem ??\todo{find number}]{fca-book}.  We shall not
give a proof of it here, as it is not within the scope of this work.

\begin{Example}
  \label{expl:star-trek-concept-lattice}
  Let us consider the formal context $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ of
  Example~\ref{expl:star-trek} a last time, and let us draw the concept lattice of $\con
  K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ in form of a line diagram.  There are 6 formal concepts of $\con
  K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$, and they can depicted as shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:star-trek-concept-lattice}.

    \label{fig:star-trek-concept-lattice}
  \end{figure}

  The line diagram of Figure~\ref{fig:star-trek-concept-lattice} uses an abridged
  annotation which is common for concept lattices: instead of annotating every node in the
  diagram with the formal concept it represents (which would yield an unreadable diagram),
  we only write every object $g$ of $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ below the \emph{smallest}
  formal concept that has $g$ in its extent.  This formal concept always exists by
  \thref{thm:concept-lattices-are-complete-lattices}.  Then, by the definition of the
  order on formal concepts, every formal concept which can be reached from the one labeled
  with $g$ by an \emph{ascending} path in the line diagram has $g$ in its diagram, and all
  other formal concepts have $g$ not in their extent.  For example, the formal concept
  labeled with \textsf{Picard} has this object in its intent, as well as the two formal
  concepts above it.  No other formal concept has \emph{Picard} in its intent.

  Likewise, for we write every attribute $m$ of $\con K_{\mathsf{TNG}}$ only at the
  \emph{largest} formal concept that has this attribute in its intent.  Then every formal
  concept that can be reached from the one labeled with $m$ by a \emph{descending} path in
  the line diagram has $m$ in its intent, and all the others have not.  Therefore, the
  node labeled with \emph{Artificial} has this attribute in its intent, as has the formal
  concept labeled with \emph{Data} and the bottom concept.  No other formal concept has
  \emph{Artificial} in its intent.

Knowledge is a necessary requirement for intelligent behavior.  For computers, in
particular, it is therefore indispensable to first obtain relevant knowledge before they
can act intelligently in certain situations.  The problem of obtaining this knowledge,
commonly referred to as the problem of \emph{knowledge acquisition} or just
\emph{learning}, is hard to approach, because computers, in contrast to human beings, are
not able to learn autonomously.  Moreover, for computers it is relevant that the knowledge
they obtain is represented in a way that is suitable for them to work with.  Thus, the
problem of \emph{knowledge representation} has also to be tackled to enable intelligent
behavior of machines.

A popular choice to represent knowledge for computers is to use logic-based formalisms,
because they yield predictable and reliable behavior.  In the area of logic-based
knowledge representation formalism, \emph{description logics} are one of the most
successful approaches.  Using \emph{description logic knowledge bases}, it is possible to
represent \emph{assertional} and \emph{terminological} knowledge.  Assertional knowledge
express facts about one or two individuals the domain for which knowledge has to be
learned.  Examples for this kind of knowledge are \enquote{Abraham Lincoln was a
  president}, or \enquote{John McCarthy was a professor at Stanford University}.  In other
words, assertional knowledge expresses \emph{assertions} about certain individuals.
Terminological knowledge represents common knowledge about all individuals of the domain
of interest.  Examples for this kind of knowledge are \enquote{all humans are mortal} or
\enquote{every human has a head}.  Thus, terminological knowledge represents dependencies
between different \emph{terms}, called \emph{concept descriptions} in the realm of
description logics.

If one chooses to represent knowledge using description logics, one is left with the
problem to obtain all relevant assertional and terminological knowledge about the domain
one is interested in.  Obtaining assertional knowledge is relatively easy to obtain:
assuming that one knows all individuals of the domain, one can gather all facts that are
known about these.  The difficulty here lies mostly in the problem automating this
process, in particular if one tries to gather facts from unstructured data, like text,
that is hard to process for computers.  On the other hand, obtaining terminological
knowledge cannot be achieved this way, since one is looking for general knowledge that
affects \emph{all} individuals of the domain.  Moreover, it is not at all easy to find the
concept descriptions which appear in this kind of knowledge.
